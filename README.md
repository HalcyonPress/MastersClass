# Everyday Fitness

This Everyday manual discusses basic fitness concepts and practice that most people can easily adopt to improve basic fitness and quality of life.

## Quality over quantity

Everyday Fitness focuses on improving health and quality of life. Rather than targeting weight or distance, Everyday Fitness focuses on developing quality breath, firm and pliable muscles, and core stability.

**Belly breathing** is foundational. Of course, if you're reading this, you're breathing. But just like any activity, breath can be improved through intentional, periodic practice. Deep, quality breaths increase the availability of oxygen, improve focus, and reduce stress.

**Firm and pliable muscles** help us avoid injury and reduce physical stress. Muscles which are too loose can lead to tears and joint injury, while muscles which are too hard increase physical stress and reduce blood flow. "Balanced" muscles, which are firm, yet pliable support joint stability, reduce physical stress, and improve blood-flow.

**Core stability** is all about avoiding injury, especially back injury.
