# Everyday Fitness

This Everyday manual discusses basic fitness concepts and practice that most people can easily adopt to improve basic fitness and quality of life. This manual was originally created by the Masters Class (TODO: link) podcast hosted by Charles Lowell (TODO: link) and Zane Rockenbaugh (TODO: link).

## Consider your conditions

Before embarking on any exercise regime, take a moment to consider your personal condition.

## Quality over quantity

Everyday Fitness focuses on quality of life. Though explicitly data-driven, we use numeric measures as a feedback mechanism to help us figure out what what let's us feel better.

Our goal here is actually to exercise as little as possible. While many exercise programs encourage us to "exercise more", our goal is to maximize benefit per-hour exercised. In other words, to get he most bang for the buck.

As with any practice, consistency is key. Our approach, therefore, is to "exercise least" by exercising better.

## Foundations

In particular, we focus on developing three core practices:

* quality breath,
* supple muscles, and
* core stability.

### Belly breathing

Of course, if you're reading this, you're breathing. But just like any activity, breath can be improved through intentional, periodic practice. Deep, belly (aka, stomach or diaphragmatic) breaths increase the availability of oxygen, improve focus, and reduce stress.



#### Nose vs mouth



### Supple musculature

Supple muscles help us avoid injury and reduce physical stress. Muscles which are too loose can lead to tears and joint injury, while muscles which are too hard increase physical stress and reduce blood flow. "Balanced" muscles, which are firm, yet pliable support joint stability, reduce physical stress, and improve blood-flow.


### Core stability

Core stability is all about avoiding injury, especially back injury.
